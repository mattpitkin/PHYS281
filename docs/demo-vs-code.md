# VS Code

Virtual Studio (VS) Code is a text editor produced by Microsoft. Many other very good text editors
are available! It can be used for writing and edited any plain text files, but is mostly used for
writing code. The main useful features for code editing are syntax highlighting and code linting.

## Installing VS Code

To install VS Code:
 
 * go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download in your web browser (or just Google "VS Code download");
 * click the appropriate large blue button to download the installer file for your operating system;
 * Windows: click on the Downloaded installer file (named something like
   `VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.46.1.exe` where `1.46.1` was the current version at the time of writing,
   but this may have increased);
 * Windows: accept the license agreement and click "Next";
 * Windows: leave the default install location unchanged (unless you want to change things and know what you are doing) and click "Next";
 * Windows: leave the default "Start Menu Folder" name unchanged and click "Next";
 * Windows: for "Select Additional Tasks" leave the tick boxes unchanged (the "Add to PATH" box should be ticked by default) and click "Next";

If writing Python code you should install the "Python" extension for VS Code:

## Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is where the editor automatically highlight various . When you save a file in VS
Code with the `.py` file extension, it will know it is a Python file and enable the highlighting.
