# Installing Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is a Python distribution and package
management system. It provides an installation of Python and a way to create "virtual environments"
that can contain different Python version and software packages required for a specific task.

The official instructions for installing Anaconda on a variety of operating systems can be found
[here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), but we will also go through the steps below.

=== "Windows 10"
    ## Installation on Window 10

=== "Mac OS"
    ## Installation on Mac OS


=== "Linux"
    ## Installation on Linux

    For Linux users we recommend just installing the lightweight Miniconda package rather than the
    full Anaconda installation. Instructions for installing Miniconda under Linux can be found
    [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html),
    which we summarise below.

    The instructions below are those for installation via command line only.

    * Download the [latest Miniconda installation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers) file from
      https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh either via your browser
      or from the command line with, e.g.,

    ```bash
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```
