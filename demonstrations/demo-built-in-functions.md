# Built-in functions

The are a set of [built-in
functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#built-in-functions) that are a part of
any Python installation.

We will describe a few common functions here.

## `print`

to print text to the screen.

## Keywords

Along with the built-in functions, there are a set of [reserved
keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp) in Python that have a specific
meaning and cannot be used for variable of function names.
